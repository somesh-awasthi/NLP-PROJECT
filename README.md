# NLP-PROJECT
SmTm_AlRt
This repository contains the codebase for the SmTm_AlRt project.

Introduction
In this project, we are building an early disease predictor through symptoms. For example, if a patient is feeling unwell and types their symptoms, we will attempt to predict the disease. This will help patients identify early symptoms of diseases.

Technologies Used
Python: Used as the primary programming language for backend development and data processing.
React: Utilized for frontend development to create a dynamic user interface.
Croma DB (tentative): Initially considered as the database solution. There's a potential plan to migrate to Pinecone.
JupyterLab: Integrated into the development environment for interactive Python development and data analysis.
Other Libraries:
NumPy: Used for numerical computing and array manipulation.
pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Utilized for machine learning tasks and predictive modeling.

python -m venv env
2. Activate Virtual Environment: Activate the virtual environment.
.\env\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies: Install required Python dependencies using pip.
